Ring World is a fun read. It has a few scenes where the main character has sex. It’s easily skip-able if you’d like. It’s short and usually general, minus one explicit time. That aside, the story really is a fun unpredictable adventure.

It leaves you feeling hopeful and interested. I didn’t continue the series. Only because, at the time I was looking for something that is a little more serious. Ring World however, is lighthearted and fun. It deals with some fun and different aliens. The science aspect is also impressive at times, despite the well known fact that the science of the ring world is wrong in a few aspects. It’s presented in a way that you’ll likely not understand enough to care.

The book is slow to get going. There is very little world building. I’d recommend this book to anyone that likes “Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy” but wants something less tangential, and more on topic.
Overall, I liked this book. It was a fun departure from the super serious Michael Crichton books and more about exploring the unknown, while still feeling safe and like everything will work out in the end.
