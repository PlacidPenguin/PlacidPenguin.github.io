Sphere really is, a great book. It’s set in an underwater habitat. It’s essentially a mystery horror survival book with a great twist. I loved this book. It starts out a little slow and builds up to a truly suspenseful ending. I wish I could discuss the ending in more detail because it’s fun to hear other’s opinions on a certain aspect of the book, however that would be a MAJOR spoiler!

Overall, if you’re looking for a very suspenseful mystery with a bit of some psychological thriller mixed in, you’ll love it. I think this is one of Michael Crichton’s best books. I’ve never seen the movie but I doubt it’s even half as good as this book.
