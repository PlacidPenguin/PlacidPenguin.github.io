  Absolutely loved it. This is an amazing book. It's so entertaining! 1980s nostalgia, lots of action, a bit of romance and a great plot. The movie is drastically different than this book. This book has more depth into the characters, different plot lines and it’s just better, as a whole. There are some terrific ups and downs in this book. It’s set in a dystopian cyperpunk future where everyone spends their time in a virtual reality world learning, working and playing. This book was a great “escape” book for me while on my long drives to work. I listened to it on audible and the reader was, the one and only, “Wil Wheaton.” He did a phenomenal job reading it. I highly recommend this version if you get the audio book. That aside, this is the type of book that I was sad to finish. I wanted the story, character and world to keep on going. The book was so immersive and the story picks up so fast it’s like a rollercoaster ride. Buckle up and hang on. It really kept me guessing at times too. There is A LOT of swearing and some 12 year old boy humor, as well. I highly recommend it to anyone that is looking for a great read that’s essentially about overcoming one’s own self-nature, economic setbacks and the struggles of a broken family.
