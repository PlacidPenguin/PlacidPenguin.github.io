  This book picks up right where *The Final Empire* leaves off. We are in utter chaos and need some structure in the world. This book is just like the first one. More awesome magic fighting with a cleverly structured magic system. Where the first book is more about intrigue and learning. This book is more about survival. It builds up some very lovable characters and introduces more backstory to the Kandra. It has some pretty entertaining scenes and some excellent plot twists. I enjoyed this book a bit more than the first book, which is incredible because I loved the first one. Overall, I highly recommend this book anyone that enjoyed *The Final Empire*.
