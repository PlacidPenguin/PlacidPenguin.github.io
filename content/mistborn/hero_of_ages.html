  Again, no breather here. This book starts out right where *The Well of Ascension* stops. I was a little disappointed in the lack of follow through with the strong female character feel that the other two books achieved. This is not to say anything with the plot is flawed. It just felt like there was a great opportunity here, which wasnâ€™t realized. Besides that, this book dives deeper in the darkness that is Ruin. Finally, we get all the answers you've been waiting for along with some pleasant surprises. I can't really say more about this series, other than I absolutely love it. I feel like this series achieves what every fantasy book series is striving to be. Overall, I was very sad to finish this series, however I'm elated that I had the pleasure of reading it and recommend it to anyone that is into fantasy.
