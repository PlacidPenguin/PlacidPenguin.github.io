  Magic, dystopian and staring an incredibly talented powerful female character, whatâ€™s not to like? If you've read The Stormlight Archive you can consider this series like that, but with A LOT of the world building (fat?) cut out. This is a fast paced epic. Vin, our main protagonist heroine gets to fight, fight and fight some more. I loved this series. I thought it was truly fantastic in every way. Do be warned, this series does fall a little short on, what seems like a strong feministic stance. This is surprising, because it seems to masquerade as one. That aside, this is a great foray into fantasy books. This book has it all, action, intrigue and some light world building. The magic system is unparalleled. Brandson Sanderson does a phenomenal job of explaining it without it becoming cumbersome. It's a great leap into fantasy/adventure. I highly recommend this book to anyone that looking to jump into the genre of high fantasy, but hasn't built up the tolerance to world building that often happens in these types of books.
