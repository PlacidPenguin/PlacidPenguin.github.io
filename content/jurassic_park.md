  Loved it! The movie is very close to the book as far as events and plot. It felt like an extended addition version of the movie. There are a few differences from the movie regarding the plot, though, but not impactful. If you liked the movie you'll love the book. Its suspensful and thrilling. I really enjoyed it because there was nothing deep or hard to grasp. It's a great book if you just want to sit down relax and be emersed in a scarey and fun world, that seems, not to far off.
