Wow! Children of Time is truly amazing. I’d describe this as an almost post-apocalyptic space survival with a bit of thriller mixed in. Children of Time relies on a fresh set of ideas to build the truly amazing plot. The characters have some depth, predictability and are true to themselves. One thing I can’t stand in a book/movie is when characters suddenly make a decision that seems obtuse in order to further the plot. Children of Time overcomes poor plot planning and rote sci-fi tropes, that other sci-fi books depend on, through fresh new ideas.

This book is bleak at times and very realistic based on the current trajectory of our geopolitical climate. Children of Time, ultimately, delivers a warning. However, depressing at times I thought this book tries to teach society a lesson that we need to stop chasing each other, learn to work together, be open to new opportunities and actually learn from the past. 

Overall, I loved this book. It altered my perspective on the future of the human race. Likewise, it gives one hope for the mankind. Children of Time is delightfully depressing, a little dark, ironic and hopeful. Yes, I realize that statement is very contradictory. However, it holds true. This book reaches for something bigger than a space thriller and delivers, via its refreshingly new conflict and resolution concepts and protagonists. Warning: If you have a dislike for arachnids, reader beware – that’s all I can say for fear of spoilers.
