<p class=MsoNormal>Great book. If you like Michael Crichton books, then you'll
feel right at home with this one. It all starts out with a moonshot scientific
experiment. Naturally, something goes wrong and then the mystery must be solved
before too much carnage ensues. This book is highly technical in some aspects.
More so than Jurassic Park. You may actually learn something about biology. This
almost feels like short lecture on micro-biology. That aside, the book is very
intriguing. I couldn’t put it down. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Andromeda Strain is full of theoretic biology, some
existential philosophy, action, and some mystery. It leaves you feeling like
perhaps it would be fun to learn more about micro-organisms and diseases.
Michael Crichton really delivers. Overall, I thought this was a great read.
Difficult at times due to the plethora of scientific terms (mainly names of
diseases), however it’s easy enough to understand and you don’t really need to
know any of it to follow the plot. I recommend this book to anyone that wants a
good science fiction that will leave you feeling smarter than before, make you
question the definition of living and doesn’t really have any slowdowns, or perceived
conjecture.</p>
