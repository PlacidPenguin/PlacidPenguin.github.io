Perhaps, I didn’t get it. Annihilation is confusing at best. I didn’t like this book. I would not recommend it to anyone. Perhaps, if you’re high this book is awesome. The descriptions of events are so abstract and obscure that I really had a hard time figuring out what was happening.

If the book is supposed to be extremely confusing and very slow then it definitely succeeded. This book leaves you will only questions. Don’t expect to get many answers later on either. The second book doesn’t do much better. I wouldn't say it was a poorly writen book. I feel like it's misrepresented. If you're going to read it, know that it's a slow building, mystery with no resolution. Certainly not an action suspense sci-fi. It has aspects of the latter, however don't read it if that's what your looking for.

I recommend watching the movie. Natalie Portman has one of the most badass scenes ever. Unloading a magazine with a fully automatic assault rifle in slow motion into a strange creature, is one of the coolest scenes in Hollywood. The movie is much better. It vaguely follows the book, for the better. It basically has a similar outcome but with much more action, and way more explanations.

Overall, this is a book about an expedition into an unknown region of the Deep South that has encountered a strange extraterrestrial growth. That’s the problem with this book. The subject matter is so unique and compelling it’s hard not to want to read it. However, after trudging through this book I can’t recommend it to anyone. Annihilation just doesn’t really deliver, and neither do the rest of the books.
