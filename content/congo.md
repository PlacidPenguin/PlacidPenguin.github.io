Set in the dense jungle of the Congo, hence the name, this book feels like an exotic adventure. I thoroughly enjoyed this book because of the setting. An expedition cut off from the rest of the world that has to fend for themselves using the tools around them and their intellect alone. 

I liked how this book makes you feel like you’re in the jungle. It’s gory and downright scary at times. Congo is slow to get started, besides the typical Michael Crichton hook in the beginning. I didn’t mind it though because it’s such a mystery. I really enjoyed trying to figure it out. 

Overall, if you’re looking for something a little slower paced, clever and has some series Jules Verne tones to it you’ll enjoy Congo.
