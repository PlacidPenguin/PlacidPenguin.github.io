  Wow! As someone that has never gone down the fantasy book rabbit hole, this one was insane. First off this book is HUGE! It was the largest book I had ever read, 1007 pages in total. I listened to this book on audible. It was amazing. The world building is massive. There were lulls for sure, for me. However, the payoff was fantastic. It became one of my favorite books overnight. Though, I would not recommend this to most people. Due to its very heavy fantasy world building tropes. 

It has a magic system that is well defined and thorough. Just enough to help you understand it, make things seem finite and still be pleasently surprising. This book mainly follows a character though his darkest of times and best. There is some sweet sweet revenge towards the latter half, as well as some beautiful redemption. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this book to many people. Its long, drawn out and sometimes very frustration (due to Brandon Sandersons cliffhangery writing style). That being said if your interested in a very long, detailed, fantastic and well thoughtout story I encourage you to just jump on into the Cosmere.
