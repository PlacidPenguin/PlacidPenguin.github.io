  Build up, that's the best way to descibe this book. There is definitely some more awesome fighting. However, we are going to focus *a lot* on Dalinar's backstory. We get some more new characters, new baddies and some interesting side stories concerning Szeth. This book was the hardest for me to get through. I actually started and finished reading the entire Mistborn Trillogy all while half way through Oathbringer. I'll say this, I'm glad I finished it. However, this book poses all questions and very few answers. Likewise, I didn't care to much about a few of the new characters that were introduced. Kaladin is the most interesting character to me, and he gets a little sidelined in this book as we learn more about Dalinar's dark secrets and explore more of Shallan and Adolin. There is less detailed fighting in this book and more standing back and watching. I still really enjoyed this book. Perhaps my slightly jaded review, is because I jumped straight into Oathbringer right out of the saddle of *Words of Radience*. A little burn out, maybe? Overall, I still enjoyed this book however, I felt like it was the weakest of the *Stormlight Archive* thus far. Finally, you have to read it if you've already read the others, because there's still more books planned in this saga and you'd hate to get left behind in the *Everstorm*.
