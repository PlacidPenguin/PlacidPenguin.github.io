  I enjoyed The Way of Kings so much that I just jumped straight into this one. I might have already had the book downloaded before I finished The Way of Kings. Buckle up. This book introduces lots of new characters, more evil plots and some serious issues. There is A LOT of spectacular fighting scenes described in suberb detail. Also, more world building. You get to learn more about the Parshendi. Shallan gets some well deserved backstory and general awesomeness. This is just as good as the The Way of Kings. There are still many chapters dedicated to world building and Brandon Sanderson continues his cliffhanger style of writing. I understand that juggling many charaters, with each one integral to the story, is difficult. However, It can get quite frustrating at times. For example, when you've spent a full chapter with nothing really pressing happening besides world building and mental dialog for the charater then, right as some action is about to happen we are switched to another character with basically the same thing happening again. As a reader this can be like watching a season finale and then expecting to get some answers in the new season, but just getting another season finale. I understand that this is happening because we have multiple concurrent events all progressing at the same time, at times it feels a little gimmicky. Overall, pressing through those minor gripes this book was truely awesome. I'd recommend it again to anyone that wants a deep dive into the world of high fantasy books.
