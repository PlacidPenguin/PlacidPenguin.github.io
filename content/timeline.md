Like all Michael Crichton books, this one blurs the line of fact and fiction. It certain does a great job giving you a minor history lesson. Timeline takes you on a historical thrill ride. This book is slow to start. It does this on purpose because once the action starts, it’s relentless. 

Timeline is more a fun book than anything else. It’s not riddled with scientific terms and facts like some of his other books. It’s a good easy read. A bit stressful at times and also has a bit of a twist. Overall, this is great book if you’re looking for something that seems almost a bit more of a historical sci-fi, if that’s even a genre, that’s easy to read, great fun, and packed with action.
