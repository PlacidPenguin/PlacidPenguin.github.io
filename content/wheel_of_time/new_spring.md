  This book was very focused on world building. You end up with more questions than answers. It feels a little slow for the whole first half. A lot like LOTR: Fellowship of the Ring. It took me a while to get through because it was boring for me. However, there is plenty of action later on. The book left me with a desire to continue the series because the unknown is so great I really wanted more. Overall, one must remember this is a very long series as such, Robert Jordan takes his time explaining in detail the world and characters. This world is very old and expansive which resulted in me wanted to learn more about certain aspects. The character development is slow and a bit shallow in this first book.
