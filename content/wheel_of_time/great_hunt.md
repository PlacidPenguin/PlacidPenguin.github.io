  This book starts you out a little confused for a while. Again, its slow to get started. However, it really picks up later with lots of action. The characters get some needed development which actually resulted in me starting to really enjoy the book. I liked it better than the first one. The world of magic begins to unfold in this book. It's really a great build up to the third book. This book was so compeling towards the end that I immediately started reading the third book, once I finished this one. Overall, this book got my attention much quicker than the second and I was pleased that the characters received more development.
