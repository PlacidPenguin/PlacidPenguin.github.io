This is book is constant action. If you were bored in the previous two books then you'll love this one. Almost from the moment you start reading this one there is constant action. Whether it be someone is being chased, some is chasing, someone is hiding or someone is hunting someone else. This book is packed full of awesome Aes Sedia fights. Seriously, the action in this book is relentless at times. It’s awesome. Aside from that, the plot is heavily focused on Mat! 

If you didn’t really like Mat in the previous book, well hold your judgement until the end of this book. I certainly got a little fed up with Mat in “The Great Hunt”. Without spoiling anything, this one was really fun for me. There are new characters, old ones get more back story, new love interests and some new seriously bad baddies. It ends with a serious bang. I’d wager you’ll want to jump straight into the 4th book after you finish this book.
