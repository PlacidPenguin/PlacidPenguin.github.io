### This site serves as the backend for the small book review site that I host for my family and friends.
 

## To make a review   

1. Navigate to the [contents](content/) folder.
2. Click the ![](https://github.com/PlacidPenguin/PlacidPenguin.github.io/blob/master/resources/create_new_file_btn.PNG) button towards the top right.
3. Give your file a name i.e., if you read "The Great Gatsby" name your file ```great_gatsby.md```. *Pro Tip: try to leave of leading "articles" such as, "The" or "A" in file name. Likewise, use "_" instead of spaces and use lower case.*
4. Copy and paste the following into your newly created file:
```
---
layout: page
title: The Great Gatsby
author: Your name
date: Jan 8 2020
---
  YourAwesomeBookReview 
```
5. Leave ```Layout: page``` untouched and fill in the rest.
